ACs

1. use csv script to pull all data and sort items into each month by:
    - total money invested (deposits) #DONE
    - total dividends #DONE
    - money withdrawn #DONE

2. use each date to populate the Investments and Interest by month sheet
  - we can use 2 dictionaries to associate each Month with a column (eg. January B) #DONE
   - money invested is on row 6 #DONE
   - Dividends is row 7 #DONE
   - withdrawn is row 8 #DONE
3. split dividends based on domestic and foriegn share holdings to make things easier for tax years # DONE
4. split sheets by different years currently for POC. I am using current normal annual years not financial years. I want to give the option for both. #DONE

Build order:

// drop csv in convert folder
// get and parse CSV
// process CSV
// use google API to update 120uEAV3SII0CWxaeLLeaHCBxXBHhXo0r_edZaYIRs6c
// check results


Future TODOs

5. have the sheets updated by the data rather than using a static arg.
