ACs

1. use csv script to pull all data and sort items into each month by:
    - total money invested (deposits)
    - total dividends
    - money withdrawn

2. use each date to populate the Investments and Interest by month sheet
  - we can use 2 dictionaries to associate each Month with a column (eg. January B)
   - money invested is on row 6
   - Dividends is row 7
   - withdrawn is row 8

Build order:

// drop csv in convert folder
// get and parse CSV
// process CSV
// use google API to update 120uEAV3SII0CWxaeLLeaHCBxXBHhXo0r_edZaYIRs6c
// check results


Future TODOs

3. split dividends based on domestic and foriegn share holdings to make things easier for tax years
4. split sheets by different sheets currently for POC. I am using current normal annual years not financial years. I want to give the option for both.
